# Open Source

The following is a list of selected repositories and corresponding code published as free/libre open source software on our github organization.


## SELFY VSOC

[The SELFY VSOC repository](https://github.com/securityinmobility/selfy-vsoc-api) is one of the contributions from the research group in the [EU-funded SELFY project](https://selfy-project.eu/). It holds the full Vehicle Security Operations Center (VSOC) stack that consists of the following components:

- ELK stack (elasticsearch, logstash, and kibana)
- VSOC API (HTTP REST)
- Locust test scripts 
- Binary scanning tool


## DC Charging Station

[This Github repository](https://github.com/securityinmobility/dc-charging-station) contains glue code in order to create a fully working DC charging station.

In our case we use [EcoG/iso15118](https://github.com/EcoG-io/iso15118) for the ISO15118 stack, an [EVAcharge SE](https://chargebyte.com/products/charging-station-communication/evacharge-se) for powerline communication and a [Kratzer Automation battery tester](https://www.ni.com/de/shop/power-electronics-test-systems.html) as a HV power supply.
We also built a smaller / portable charging station which uses an [Elektro Automatik EA-PSB 11000](https://elektroautomatik.com/shop/en/products/programmable-dc-laboratory-power-supplies/bidirectional-dc-laboratory-power-supplies/series-psb-10000-2u-1-5-3kw/1147/bi-directional-power-supply) as a HV power supply.


## AUTOSEC Framework

[The AUTOSEC Framework](https://github.com/securityinmobility/autosec-framework) holds various attacker scripts to attack and features to interact with modern vehicle systems. It is continually extended with new attacks and updated to support further technologies.


## Vehicle logs 

[Our vehiclelogs github repository](https://github.com/securityinmobility/vehiclelogs) contains various CAN logs, PCAP files etc. that we collected from vehicles. Currently the following directories:

- Tesla Model 3: CAN Dumps from all three bus systems
- Volkswagen ID 4: CAN Dumps
- Renault Twizy: CAN dumps
- ESA 5000: Single wire UART dumps of an electric scooter sold by Lidl 
- vehicle2grid: High level ISO15118 charging station communication dumps


## Exploit to module conversion

[This programm](https://github.com/securityinmobility/exploit-to-module-conversion) is for converting exploit code into a module for an automated penetration testing framwork e.g. the [AUTOSEC framework](#autosec-framework).


## Custom monocypher-rs library

[The monocypher-rs repository](https://github.com/securityinmobility/monocypher-rs) is a minimal, easily expendable rust binding for the [Monocypher](https://monocypher.org/) cryptography library.

It is inspired by [Jan Schreib's monocypher-rs](https://github.com/jan-schreib/monocypher-rs) implementation, but several functions were necessary in our application that are not covered by his version. The binding was also created to get familiar with bindgen.


## Survey data for publications 

[The survey-data repository](https://github.com/securityinmobility/survey-data) holds the raw survey data from publications of ours.
